Lab Day 8: Graph Algorithms - Graph traversal
8.1 Aim of the program: Consider an undirected graph where each edge weights 2 units. Each of
the nodes is labeled consecutively from 1 to n. The user will input a list of edges for describing
an undirected graph. After representation of the graph, from a given starting position
● Display the breadth-first search traversal.

● Determine and display the shortest distance to each of the other nodes using the breadth-
first search algorithm. Return an array of distances from the start node in node number

order. If a node is unreachable, return -1 for that node.
Input Format:
 The first line contains two space-separated integers „n‟ and „m‟, the number of nodes and
edges in the graph.
 Each line „i‟ of the „m‟ subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers „u‟ and
„v‟, that describe an edge between nodes „u‟ and „v‟.
 The last line contains a single integer „s‟, the node number to start from.
Output Format:
 The first line shows the result of the BFS traversal.
 The last line shows an array of distances from node „s‟ to all other nodes.

Input:
5 4
1 2
1 4
4 5
2 5
1
Output:

BFS Traversal: 1 2 4 5
Distance [2 -1 2 4]
