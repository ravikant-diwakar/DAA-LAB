Lab Day 7: Dynamic Programming

7.1 Aim of the program: Write a program to implement the matrix chain multiplication problem
using M-table & S-table to find optimal parenthesization of a matrix-chain product. Print the
number of scalar multiplications required for the given input.

  Note# Dimensions of the matrices can be inputted as row and column values. Validate the
dimension compatibility.
Input:
Enter number of matrices: 4
Enter row and col size of A1: 30 35
Enter row and col size of A2: 35 15
Enter row and col size of A3: 15 5
Enter row and col size of A4: 5 10
Output:
M Table:
0 15750 7875 9375
0 0 2625 4375
0 0 0 750
0 0 0 0
S Table:
0 1 1 3
0 0 2 3
0 0 0 3
0 0 0 0
Optimal parenthesization: ( ( A1 (A2 A3)) A4)
The optimal ordering of the given matrices requires 9375 scalar multiplications.

7.2 Aim of the program: Write a program to find out the Longest Common Subsequence of two
given strings. Calculate length of the LCS.

  Input:

Enter the first string into an array: 10010101
Enter the second string into an array: 010110110

Output:
LCS: 100110
LCS Length: 6
